# Twitter Analysis Web
This is a web application related to the [Twitter Analysis project](https://github.com/francisgalvez/twitter-analysis) in which we can visualize the streamed data on a Leaflet map.

Specifically, this project has been deployed in Openshift, thank to one of its preconfigured Node templates. Nevertheless, it can be successfully deployed in any other way.
